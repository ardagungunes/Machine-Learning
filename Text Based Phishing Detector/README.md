Phishing is a cybercrime in which a target or targets are 
contacted by email, telephone or text message by someone posing as 
a legitimate institution to lure individuals into providing sensitive 
data such as personally identifiable information, banking and credit 
card details, and passwords.

In our project, we aimed to create a threat-intelligence 
system for phishing detection, focusing on HTML content analysis. 
Our objective was to deepen our understanding of text and machine 
learning while emphasizing the critical role of semantics in tackling 
cybersecurity challenges. Using multi-lingual and mono-lingual 
sentence transformers, along with Google Translate, we generated 
768-dimensional feature vectors for each HTML file. The next step 
involved building machine learning classifiers trained on these 
embedding vectors. This research-driven task aimed to enhance our 
grasp of essential concepts and improve implementation techniques 
in the cybersecurity domain
